        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a full time student at CSULB. I  graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School. I am currently persuing a degree in computer engineering. I enjoy spending time with friends and family because they bring me happiness and joy throughout tough times. I do not have a lot of friends but my small group of friends are the ones that I enjoy being with the most. My family is everywhere but I still enjoy talking and spending time with them.
